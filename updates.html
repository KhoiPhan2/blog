            <h2>Market day 2/2/2025</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, the market has pretty much done what I referenceed yesterday, a large dip and the a recovery due to digestion of the news. Although it has only been 4 hours.</p>
            <p>As I have updated I have moved all of my positions into SPGC, there is nothing wrong with my other ideas, but this is a time of volatility </p>
            <p>and the opporunity was too great to pass up. PennyStocks are nice because they're disconnected from the larger market, its like taking a break </p>
            <p>in a cabin when there is a snowstorm out. Nothing really moves pennystocks except for their own valuation and momentum. I think this week will continue to be mixed or down </p>
            <p>Market next week will most likely be as most of the trump tariffs are fully digested.</p>

            <h2>Market Brief for this week 2/2/2025</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone. After a pretty rough day on Friday, we are getting ready for an even rougher day. With the tariffs going into effect, we have confirmation of the 10% tariff on China that we expected.</p>
            <p>I expect a sharp decrease and then a rebound as the market begins to digest the news. BABA seems like a good deal, and I wouldn't hesitate to add here. Micron also seems like it will be a deal tomorrow as chip stocks head lower.</p>
            <p>This week will be volatile, and I'm not sure where the market will go. However, this seems like a good buying opportunity unless Trump continues to threaten more tariffs on European countries, which is a real possibility.</p>
            <p>Overall, I'm not too worried. Micron and BABA are fundamentally undervalued compared to most other stocks, so they should outperform relative to tech.</p>

            <h2>Market Update 1/30/2025</h2>
            <p>Hello guys! Today is a good day for my positionsâ€”I'm up roughly 10-12%. BABA is continuing to go up more than expected.</p>
            <p>I expect it to continue to $110 before any significant pullback. With earnings next week, this trade is pretty risky.</p>
            <p>I expect the company to beat expectations, but I'm sure the market will dump it after earnings for no reason.</p>
            <p>The markets are quite manipulated, and Wall Street likely wants to buy in at a lower price before the real rally begins.</p>
            <p>I would caution against entering a position now. I may be wrong, and it could continue to rally. However, if BABA drops, I would comfortably add at $95.</p>
            <p>I'm not sure how often I will post updates. You can likely expect 2 to 3 updates per week.</p>
