            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I am Khoi, this is a more personal blog about something that I am passionate about. Peer into my mind, and find my great stock ideas and do with you will with them. First things first, all these ideas are my own ideas, no matter how nonsensical they may be. Also if you follow my trades and lose money its not my fault.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all these things considered this is not financial advice, and lets get this bread. I will try to be as transparent as possible, about my positions and hopefully soon. Screenshots will be posted, however unfortunately I am not super comfortable with other people knowing my exact positions and quantity. Maybe as time progresses this will change.
            </p>
            <p>
                My positions will most likely be more risky than most investments so I caution against going with my ideas 1:1 extrapolate what you want from them. I eventually hope to make a YT channel.
            </p>

            <h2>SPGC, a once in a blue moon stock</h2>
            <p>2/03/2025</p>
            <p>Sometimes in the stock market you stumble upon an opportunity so great it triumphs all of your other ideas. SPGC is one of them.</p>
            <p>I'm writing this about SPGC because of their incredible brand growth, recognition and revenue. SPGC is a super pennystock. Risky as hell, but the fundamentals are there.</p>
            <p>They basically sell golf clubs, really insignificant but their revenues tell the story, so I'm just going to dive into their financials now. </p>
            <p>Their market cap is 5 million, and their revenue from this quarter for 1.2 million and has grown 1000% since last year. This resulted in a large run up from earnings</p>
            <p>It ran up all the way to a dollar and then pulled back to 50 cents. Some concerns I see are profitablity however their margins are beginning to increase but make no mistake the company is bleeding about a million per quarter. </p>
            <p>Now usually profitability is a huge concern of mine especially with these penny stocks, due to fear stock offerings in order to raise capital, but this stock today just announced a 1 million dollar buyback from this year to next year. </p>
            <p>This basically is screaming the company knows it is undervalued. Even if the stock didn't move for the next year, the company would buy back 20% of the company. With all these things in mind everything points to up.</p>
            <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

            <p> ALL IN, FULL PORTFOLIO @ .60 </p>

            <h2>Micron, selling the high bandwidth memory shovel for the AI gold rush</h2>
            <p>1/29/2025</p>
            <p>As this is my first blog post lets first catch you guys up on my current stock ideas. I currently hold Micron which I believe will stand to benefit in the next two years.</p>
            <p>Micron sells DRAM/NAND and generally memory to other businesses similarly to other household names such as samsung and sk hynix. Now, to be honest this memory isn't anything  </p>
            <p>I care about too much because generally memory is considered an commodity as opposed to other semiconductor products. This is because basically memory is interchangeable from company to company.</p>
            <p>Now why am I bringing all this bad news up when I think the company will do well? High bandwidth memory is different. Micron is currently dominating this field, outcompeting its competitors in Nvidia's latest chips. High bandwidth memory is used in  </p>
            <p>AMD and Nvidia's GPUs that are used to train AI. Some other things to note, with the coming tariffs on outside chips coming from the administration, micron positions itself as the largest HBM </p>
            <p>manufacturer in the USA. They additionally also won a ton of money from the CHIPS act which will only increase their productions and hold on the HBM market. DeepSeek also just plunged the market</p>
            <p>so the time is good to buy, as I believe it is trading at a discount. Its not all roses though, HBM is a competitive market, however Micron seems to have a comfortable lead and more tailwinds then most.</p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>Some more additional financial metrics that are of note to me.</p>
            <p>PE Ratio (FWD) : 14.31 statistically lower than most S&P 500 tech companies at the moment. Means discount/Undervalued! </p>
            <p>In 2028, Micron expects HBM total addressable market (TAM) to grow four times from the $16 billion level in 2024 and to exceed $100 billion by 2030. They're also already sold out for the next two years. </p>
            <p>Data center revenue grew over 400% year over year, stargate will increase this most likely and tech continues to expand their datacenters</p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>My position</p>
            <p>90$ calls dated for 1/15/27, opened(1/30/2025) position is still open! will update if position is closed. </p>
            <p>My short term price target based on my algorithm (my intuition and gut feeling): 110$  </p>
            <p>My long term price target based on these facts (not my intuition and gut feeling): 130$  </p>

            <h2>Alibaba, leading the way back for China</h2>
            <p>1/29/2025</p>
            <p>Chinese stocks are widely known as value traps for years, and as charlie munger said "one of his greatest investment mistakes". Well I'm not Charlie Munger and what could he possibly know. </p>
            <p>Well times have changed old man, and the financial headwinds that china has faced for the past 3 years are very slowly turning into tail winds. China is becoming more and more serious about stimulating their economy.</p>
            <p>This is widely referenced in their pboc meetings, often promising more stimulus. Here are some examples: The government has introduced special sovereign bonds totaling 2 trillion yuan (approximately $284.43 billion USD) </p>
            <p>to finance infrastructure projects and other economic initiatives. In September 2024, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) reduced the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, aiming to enhance liquidity and support economic activity.</p>
            <p>Now more recently with the news of deepseek and alibabas new model qwen, the and high valuations on US companies. Chinese companies start to seem more appealing. Fortunately for me but unfortunately for you guys I bought on 1/24/25, so</p>
            <p>the market has most likely already priced in the new AI information, however I believe this is the catalyst to start the chinese rally after 3 years of a bear market. Also with the next PBOC meeting march this will serve as another catalyst</p>
            <p>to propel the chinese market higher. Some other things of note, chinese markets tumbled recently due to the fear of the trump tariffs however recently trump has lowered projected rates to only 10%, way better than before. I believe the market hasn't priced this in.</p>
            <p>Even with the recent rally, I believe the risk to reward ratio remains juicy. BABA will most likely not fall below 80$ as it has been trading at that level for 3 years providing a good support. Whereas most fair value metrics have BABA much higher.</p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>Some more additional financial metrics that are of note to me.</p>
            <p>PE ratio FWD: 11.27</p>
            <p>PE ratio TTM: 19.35</p>
            <p>Balance Sheet: 1.76T in Assets, 700B in liabilities.</p>
            <p> Market Cap of 230B</p>
            <p>Share repurchase program amount: 26.1 billion (roughly 10% of the company to buy back in 3 years, actually insane)</p>
            <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>My position</p>
            <p>90$ calls dated for 1/16/26, opened(1/24/25) position is still open! will update if position is closed. </p>
            <p>My short term price target based on my algorithm (my intuition and gut feeling): unknown too volatile to tell.</p>
            <p>My long term price target based on these facts (not my intuition and gut feeling): 150$  </p>
